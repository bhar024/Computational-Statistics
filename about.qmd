title: "About Me"
---

Hey! My name is Bhargavi and I am a sophomore at Mount Holyoke College, studying computer science and mathematics. I am broadly interested in machine learning, causal inference, distributed systems and data science.

I’m also passionate about technology policy and using tech for social good, an interest I’ve explored through avenues such as being a Schuman Challenge Scholar at the EU Delegation to the US and volunteering with the Girl Up campaign of the UN Foundation.

I am always excited to dive deeper into my areas of interest through internships, research projects, and other avenues. Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bhargavi-patil) or reach out at patil22b@mtholyoke.edu!
