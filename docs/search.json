    "text": "Welcome to my website for STAT-244SC Intermediate Topics in Statistics: Computational Statistics! This Spring 2025 course explored how computation has become an essential component of modern statistical methods. In this class, we learned how computational approaches enhance statistical analysis through simulation-based techniques rather than relying solely on traditional calculus-based methods. We covered several key topics including:\n\nLinear regression\nLogistic regression for analyzing categorical outcome data\nModel evaluation approaches to assess performance\nVariable subset selection algorithms for identifying optimal predictors\nLASSO regularization for handling high-dimensional data\nK-means clustering for unsupervised learning and pattern discovery\n\nAll of our analyses were performed using R, giving us hands-on experience with coding these methods rather than just understanding them theoretically. The computational focus allowed us to tackle more complex statistical problems and gain insights that would be difficult to achieve through traditional approaches alone. The course emphasized practical research applications through our assignments and individual projects, where we applied these computational techniques to real-world data and research questions."

    "text": "We chose to explore the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset. The data set has information on the characteristics of various breast masses. The features are calculated from the digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of the breast mass. A consecutive series of 569 tumors (212 malignant, 357 benign) provided the data to develop (train) the algorithm. We think the source of our data is reliable as the data was obtained from the University of Wisconsin Hospitals, Madison from Dr. William H. Wolberg.\nThe data set has 568 rows and 32 columns. Each row corresponds to a breast mass, while each column refers to a characteristic feature. We are interested in five variables. Four of these are quantitative:\\ - perimeter_mean: the mean size of the core tumor (mm)\\ - texture_mean: the mean standard deviation of gray-scale values (pixel)\\ - smoothness_mean: the local variation in radius lengths (mm)\\ - concavity_mean: the mean of severity of concave portions of the contour (mm)\\\nThe remaining variable is categorical: Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)."

    "text": "1. Cross Validation\nCross-validation is a class of methods that estimate the test error by rate by holding out a subset of the training observations from the fitting process, and then applying the statistical learning method to those held out observations.\n\\[\\text{CV}_{(k)} = \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{j=1}^k \\text{MAE}_j\\]\nThe goal of cross-validation is to test the model’s ability to predict new data that was not used in estimating it, in order to flag problems like overfitting or selection bias and to give insight into how the model will generalize to an independent data set. Overﬁtting occurs when a model reads too much into chance features and essentially memorizes features of the data used to build it, thus reducing reliability and the ability to generalize to underrepresented populations. Cross-validation helps prevent this by providing a more reliable estimate of how well a model would generalize to unseen data.\nWe utilized a linear regression model to build and evaluate a predictive model of breast mass perimeter by concavity.\nWe incorporated 1 predictor, 2 predictors, and then 10 predictors to our model of breast mass perimeter:\n\\[\\mathbb{E}(perimeter\\_mean| concavity\\_mean) = β_0+ β_1(concavity\\_mean)\\] \\[\\mathbb{E}(perimeter\\_mean| concavity\\_mean) = β_0+ β_1(concavity\\_mean) + β_2(concavity\\_mean)^2\\]\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\mathbb{E}(perimeter\\_mean| concavity\\_mean) = \\beta_0+ \\beta_1(concavity\\_mean) + \\beta_2(concavity\\_mean)^2 + ... +\\\\ \\beta_{10}(concavity\\_mean)^{10}\n\\end{align*}\\]\nThe visualizations in Figures 10, 11, and 12 demonstrate that the more predictors are added, the more the models become overfit to the noise in our data. The model then loses its ability to generalize to new data.\nWe have trained and tested our data by creating an 80-20 train-test split. This ensures that there is a substantial amount of training data in order to evaluate a decently sized testing set.\nWe are implementing 10-fold, 8-fold, 5-fold and Leave One Out Cross-Validation. Each “held-out” fold is our test set. We are using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as our error metric:\n\\[ \\text{MAE} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left| y_i - \\hat{y}_i \\right|\\]\nWe are implementing cross-validation techniques to the following 2 models:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\mathbb{E}(perimeter\\_mean | texture\\_mean, concavity\\_mean, smoothness\\_mean) = \\\\\n\\beta_0+ \\beta_1 (texture\\_mean) +\\beta_2(concavity\\_mean) + \\beta_3(smoothness\\_mean)\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\\[\\mathbb{E}(perimeter\\_mean| texture\\_mean, concavity\\_mean) = \\beta_0+ \\beta_1 (texture\\_mean) + \\beta_2(concavity\\_mean)\\]"

Logistic regression\nLogistics regression is modeling method that allows us to adjust the linear regression model to account for binary categorical response variables by mapping probabilities between 0 and 1 to the real number range via ideas of logs and odds.\n\nThe formula for a sample logistics regression model with \\(n\\) predictors is\n\\[\nlog(odds(Y | X_1, X_2, ..., X_n)) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_1 + \\beta_2X_2 + ... + \\beta_nX_n,  \n\\]\nwhere Y represents the response variable with a binary outcome, and each \\(X_i\\) represents a quantitative explanatory variable.\nIn the context of our 4 variables of interest, our model evaluates to\n\\[\nlog(odds(Diagnosis | X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_1 + \\beta_2X_2  + \\beta_3X_3, \\beta_4X_4\n\\]\nwhere\n\n\\(X_1 =\\) perimeter_mean (mm)\n\\(X_2 =\\) texture_mean (pixel)\n\\(X_3 =\\) smoothness_mean (mm)\n\\(X_4 =\\) concavity_mean (mm)\n\\(Diagnosis\\) (1 - malignant, 0 - benign)\n\nBecause we are applying transformations on top of a regular linear regression model, there are adjustments to how we interpret the coefficients. Since this process is similar across all explanatory variables, we will only mathematically derive the interpretation for one of them for brevity.\nLet fix the value of a tumor’s \\(X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4\\) be some constants \\(a, b,c, d\\) respectively, then our model is as follows:\n\\[(eq1): log(odds(Diagnosis| X_1 = a, X_2 = b, X_3 = c, X_4 = d)) = \\] \\[\\beta_0 + \\beta_1a + \\beta_2b + \\beta_3c + \\beta_4d \\]\nIf we increase the value of \\(X_1\\) by 1, but keep all the other values the same, we would have equation 2 like so:\n\\[(eq2): log(odds(Diagnosis| X_1 = a+1, X_2 = b, X_3 = c, X_4 = d)) = \\] \\[\\beta_0 + \\beta_1(a+1) + \\beta_2b + \\beta_3c + \\beta_4d \\]\nIf we subtract eq1 from eq2, we would have \\[log(odds(Diagnosis| X_1 = a+1, X_2 = b, X_3 = c, X_4 = d)) - \\] \\[log(odds(Diagnosis| X_1 = a, X_2 = b, X_3 = c, X_4 = d)) = \\]\n\\[(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1(a+1) + \\beta_2b + \\beta_3c + \\beta_4d) - (\\beta_0 + \\beta_1a + \\beta_2b + \\beta_3c + \\beta_4d) \\]\nThis is equivalent to saying\n\\(log \\left( \\frac{\\operatorname{odds}(\\text{Diagnosis} \\mid X_1 = a+1, X_2 = b, X_3 = c, X_4 = d)}{\\operatorname{odds}(\\text{Diagnosis} \\mid X_1 = a, X_2 = b, X_3 = c, X_4 = d)} \\right) = \\beta_1\\)\nExponentiating both sides gives:\n\\[ \\frac{odds(Diagnosis| X_1 = a+1, X_2 = b, X_3 = c, X_4 = d)}{odds(Diagnosis| X_1 = a, X_2 = b, X_3 = c, X_4 = d)}= e^{\\beta_1} \\] We can rearrange this to:\n\\[ odds(Diagnosis| X_1 = a+1, X_2 = b, X_3 = c, X_4 = d)\\] \\[= e^{\\beta_1}odds(Diagnosis| X_1 = a, X_2 = b, X_3 = c, X_4 = d) \\]\nWe can interpret the above as for every 1 mm increase in the mean perimeter of the tumor ,the odds of it being malignant increases by a multiplicative factor of \\(e^{\\beta_1}\\) after adjusting for the mean texture, smoothness, and concavity.\nWe will apply this line of thinking to a section later on as we discuss the results of our model"

In unsupervised learning, we have a set of random variables \\(X_1, \\ldots, X_p\\), each with \\(n\\) observed values. But, there is no response variable \\(Y\\).\nIn K-means, we choose an integer \\(K\\), which is the number of clusters, beforehand as a tuning parameter. Let \\(C_1, \\ldots, C_K\\) denote sets containing the indices of observations in each cluster.\nThe cluster sets must satisfy:\n\n\\(C_1 \\cup C_2 \\cup \\ldots \\cup C_K = \\{1, \\ldots, n\\}\\) (each observation belongs to some cluster)\n\\(C_i \\cap C_j = \\emptyset\\) for all \\(i \\neq j\\) (no observation belongs to more than one cluster)\n\nK-means seeks to minimize the total within-cluster variation:\n\\[\\min_{C_1,\\ldots,C_K} \\sum_{k=1}^{K} W(C_k)\\]\nwhere \\(W(C_k)\\) is the within-cluster variation for cluster \\(C_k\\), commonly defined using Euclidean distance:\n\\[W(C_k) = \\frac{1}{|C_k|} \\sum_{i,j \\in C_k} \\sum_{p=1}^{P} (x_{ip} - x_{jp})^2\\] where \\(X_{ij}\\) denotes the \\(i\\)th observation of predictor \\(X_j\\).\nThe algorithm aims to find cluster assignments that make observations within each cluster as similar as possible (minimizing within-cluster variation). Each cluster is represented by its centroid (mean of all points in the cluster), and observations are assigned to the nearest centroid.\nIn our breast cancer example, we’re clustering based on tumor characteristics (like radius_mean and texture_mean) to identify natural groupings that may correspond to malignant vs. benign tumors. We chose to have k=2 clusters as we are interested in differentiating between benign and malignant. The silhouette analysis in Figure 5 shows us that k=2 is the most optimal choice both, mathematically as well as for this given research question\nWe used the MSE as our measure of error as one of the main goals in K-means is to minimize the within cluster variation which is equivalent to the mean standard error (when using Euclidean distance)."

Your classes were excellent, ensuring that I was not afraid to take on any math problem. You willingly gave me a recommendation when I came to you 2 years after graduation after having not talked to you in years, which helped me get my Masters and my current career.  Never doubt your amazing impact, and I hope you enjoy every bit of the fun of this next phase in your life.\n\n\n\n\nHi!!!! I came to MHC with an AA, concentration math. I wanted to pursue astrophysics, but signed up for all the higher level math I could find as well. You were an inspiration. You made me feel like a math minor was possible, even with a \"double major\" like astronomy and physics. (I also had a French Minor!) I have memories of your office, chatting like adults. I'm so grateful to you. Especially because the reason I likely got into MHC was a heartfelt recommendation from Ellen Ortyl, who had worked on campus. She had connected me with Laurie Kamins, whose lovely kids I had the pleasure of babysitting for! I'm just very grateful for your existence, and how you welcomed me into the fold as a transfer student from Cape Cod. &lt;3 Happy Retirement!!!!\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Robinson, I recently heard the news of your retirement, and I wanted to take a moment to express my gratitude and share your lasting impact on me, even after 10+ years post graduating Mount Holyoke. \n\nI still remember your classes vividly. Beyond the equations and proofs, you taught me how to approach problems with curiosity and persistence—skills that continue to serve me well in my personal and professional life. Your passion for mathematics and your ability to make complex concepts engaging left a lasting impression on me, and I’m so grateful to have been one of your students. Every time I've had the chance to come back on campus, I make sure to stop by your office on the 4th floor. You've taught and inspired generations of students, and I'm proud to be one of them. \n\nI wish you all the best as you enjoy this well-deserved next phase—whether it’s filled with travel, new hobbies, or just some well-earned rest.\n\nThank you!!\nKleida Martiro\nClass of 2014\n\n\n\n\nDearest Margaret, \n\nI miss you so much and wanted to share a quick update about my life. \nAfter graduating from Isenberg in 2016, I didn't get a chance to say goodbye as I was expecting my first child in May.  In the Fall of 2018, I started teaching at Santa Clara University's Finance department, where I spent four years before joining Meta as a data scientist.  My role involves developing new methodologies to measure top advertisers.  \n\nI'm grateful for your guidance and support throughout my journey.  Without you, I wouldn't be where I am today.  You played a significant role not only as my professor, but also as a mentor and guardian to help guide my paths forward.  I feel so lucky to have been one of your students and advisees.  \n\nSending you love from the sunny Bay Area!  Please visit us whenever you can. Thank you immensely for everything!  Your impact on my life is immeasurable. \n\nWith heartfelt gratitude,\n~Ning Pu (Class of 2007)\nEmail: ningpu62@gmail.com \nPhone: (413) 335-9291\n\n\n\n\nDear Professor Robinson, Thank you for inspiring a love for mathematics in us!! -- A proud fellow mathematician named K Kaya\n\n\n\n\nDear Margaret,  this is Gina Leung from class of 2012.

Thank you Margaret for showing me pure integrity and amazing work ethics.\n\n\n\n\nDear Prof Robinson/ Margaret\n\nI can't believe that you are retiring. It seems just like yesterday we were all on Skinner Green with your two little girls aged 2 and 4. You have been an inspiration to me and many other MHC students who have crossed your path Majors and Non Majors.  From your outing club stories, and your immense enthusiasm for Mathematics and life in general and it was delight to be in any of your math classes. THANK YOU for all the support you have given me over our 30 years of friendship.  I look forward to seeing you in the Spring during my 30th College Reunion.  In Gratitude and with Much Love - Cristina Ilangakoon Class of 1995 Math Major\n\n\n\n\nThank you so much for supporting me after I graduated from MoHo and gave me suggestions that really helped me to find the direction for my application. Every time talking to you, I learned a lot! Thank you for your contribution to the school and your passion for math has always inspired me!\n\n\n\n\nDear Professor Robinson- this is Heidi Zhang, class of 2021 who served as your teaching assistant during Covid period when everything was online! I think I didn’t get a chance to take your classes and our most direct interaction is being your TA. However, I always saw you in campus and in Clapp, and my friend Amelia Tran always mentioned you to me! In my memory, you are always patient and encouraging; your smile would melt the South Hadley snow. I think if I didn’t join Mount Holyoke, I probably would not pick math as major. It was the great culture math department has and the lovely professors as you made me interested in diving deeper in this subject. Due to my study aboard second half of my junior year, and covid during my senior year, my on campus live abruptly ended, which is still a great pity and pain. But reading it from a different angle, I feel like this pity will deepen my memory of the priceless math studying and campus life in Mount Holyoke. And I really want to thank you for writing me a lovely card and sending me a MHC hat as thank-you gift after serving as your TA in my senior year. Wish you have an amazing journey after retirement and look forward to seeing you again in the near future!\n\n\n\n\nDear Professor Robinson - congratulations and happy retirement. I was in your Calc and Linear Algebra classes, and really enjoyed them! Your passion for the subject, dedication to us the students, and empathy shone through. I wish you all the best on new adventures and wanted you to know that you made an impact on my life. Thank you so much! \n- Sundus Husain (2008)\n\n\n\n\nProfessor - congratulations on retiring! Thank you so much for being my advisor for four years at MHC. To an 18-year girl, first time studying outside of her native land, you are more than a mentor and a professor, dare to say that, as if I was fortunate enough at that time, to gain a mother-like figure at MHC. Wish you all the best for your future endeavors after retirement. The best is yet to come.\n\n\n\n\nHi Margaret, this is Jingyi. I missed you so much! I'll definitely come back for your retirement celebration in the spring. 😭😭😭\n\n\n\n\nProf. Margaret, Congratulations on your retirement! I still remember our office hours and how passionate you were in maths and teaching. You also had so much patience with me and all other students. I feel fortunate to have been one of your students.

Not sure I’d be where I am today without you! I know you’ll find many pursuits to fill this next chapter! Miriam ‘12\n\n\n\n\nYou really made me fall in love with math. I took Calculus I with you in my sophomore year and ended up deciding to major in math. You made the course more than just tedious calculations. Even afterwards you were always so helpful any time I emailed you for help. You’re an amazing person, and an even better professor and mentor. I was just working on a math homework assignment for my masters in AI, and it all started with taking Calculus with you. I wish you the absolute best!!\n\n\n\n\nI am so excited and happy for Professor Robinson as she enters this exciting time in her life. Professor Robinson was such a wonderful professor and person during my time st MHC. Always so positive and encouraging, I loved having classes with her and inevitably left happier than I arrived. A genuinely kind and special person. I remember returning for a reunion years ago with my two children in tow. Not only was she so happy to connect with me she spent time with my kids teaching them some math wonders - they still remember and talk about that!\n\nWishing Professor Robinson the very best and thank her for all she has given to MHC and her students.\n\n\n\n\nYour love for math inspired me to build the career that I have and share my love with my own daughters.  You are such a treasure and your impact is far reaching.  Thank you for all that you have done to further the field of mathematics and to create a space for women.\n\n\n\n\nCongratulations!  It was a pleasure to serve as your TA and a math lab tutor... 25 years ago?  That math doesn't add up!  It ended up being great preparation for my career as a law librarian and legal research professor - it helped me learn the right questions to ask while getting students/users to a proper answer. (There's not always \"the\" right answer in legal research!)  Thank you for your dedication, and best wishes for a long, fulfilling retirement.\nSuzanne Corriell, class of 2000 (statistics minor)\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Robinson! \n\nI want to thank you for all of the support you provided me in undergrad.

I am forever grateful for your help and I am so lucky to be your student! Wishing you all the best in your retirement, and let's keep in touch! :))\n\n\n\n\nDear Margaret, Thank you for being my \"secret mentor\" through graduate school!  Even though at the time I had only met you briefly (in the summer of 1997 when I was on a panel for the MHC REU students), you became my go-to contact whenever I was questioning my ability to keep going in my program and to fit into the mathematics world.  In one email response you said that \"there was room in mathematics for all different sorts of mathematicians.\"  That was so powerful that I have shared it many, many times since then with my own students and people that I mentor.  It's been a delight to become your friend over the years, and I wish you all the best in retirement!  Best wishes, Reva Kasman\n\n\n\n\nIt was a pleasure having you as an advisor.  You were always upbeat, positive and excited about work.  I wish you an adventure filled retirement.\n\n\n\n\nDear Margaret - I cannot express my gratitude enough to have you as my faculty advisor and math professor! You are an incredibly kind, loving teacher, always energetic and passionate, and have the best interests of the students in mind! It's been such an honor to be your advisee - you were like a mom to me when I first step my foot on campus in the winter of 2003 as a spring entrant coming all the way from China by myself. You inspired me to get interested in math, become more confident, and helped me kick start a great career in finance afterwards. Thank you for everything! Wish you a happy retirement and starting a new chapter in your life! With lots of love, Sixuan Chen (Class of 2006, Math major)\n\n\n\n\nAs you embark on this next chapter of your life, I wanted to take a moment to thank you not only for being an incredible professor but also for being such an inspiring human being. You didn’t just teach me math—you gave me a perspective that I’ve carried with me ever since college.\n\nI still remember coming to your office hours feeling completely overwhelmed by abstract algebra, wondering how others seemed to just know how to solve problems. You reassured me that it’s not about innate ability but about familiarity and experience—the more we encounter and engage with challenges, the more capable we become. That simple wisdom has stayed with me all these years.\n\nYour encouragement and perspective helped me push through not just college but also challenges I’ve faced in my career. Your impact has been profound, and I know countless other students feel the same.\n\nThank you for everything you’ve given to your students over the years. Wishing you a joyful and fulfilling retirement—you’ve more than earned it!\n\n\n\n\n\nCongratulations on your well-deserved retirement, Professor Robinson! I’m truly grateful to have had the opportunity to take Linear Algebra with you during my sophomore year—it was such a memorable and impactful experience. Wishing you all the best in this next chapter! 😊\n\n\n\n\nHi Professor Robinson! I did not have the opportunity to take many classes with you but I did take your Linear Algebra class in the fall of 2015 and it was one of the best classes I took at Mount Holyoke. When I majored in physical chemistry in grad school, all the lessons (and my notes!) from your class were extremely useful in my quantum classes and now in my career. Thank you for everything and I wish you the best in your future after Mount Holyoke.\nAudrey Eshun, '16\n\n\n\n\nYou have been an amazing professor and mentor for  future mathematicians and non mathematicians alike. Thank you for being amazing.\n\n\n\n\nThank you for your amazing work as an educator and mentor. Though I never took a class with you, I feel privileged to have had you as a colleague and friend 🧡\n\n\n\n\nCongrats on your very last semester! Thank you for always being our \"guiding light\" and #standingwithus. Can't wait to celebrate you!\n\n\n\n\nThank you for highlighting Math in my life! Sending all my best wishes for my favorite Prof!! Hope our paths cross again before too long!\n\n\n\n\nYour magnetic presence in the classroom was unmatched! I wish I could have taken more classes with you but will always cherish the catch ups we had each semester. The field of mathematics is forever changed by your work and mentorship. May retirement bring you much relaxation, joy, and time with those you love.\n\n\n\n\nMargaret, you were the best advisor/professor I could ever ask for. I am sooo lucky to have met you at Mount Holyoke College. I am so sorry I couldn't talk to you this semester earlier after I graduated. Yet, you've been always in my prayers and heart with deep gratitude. I am happy for you to start this new chapter of your life, and I hope it is filled with other things that you love and are passionate about besides math!\n\n\n\n\nThe dreams that I dreamed of in your office through our numerous talks have expanded into a lifelong adventure — though I'm always feeling a little afraid of the unexpected, it's something I'm willing to face head-on. \nYour wisdom, passion, and care that I experienced during my Moho life have been my inspiration, which I'm forever thankful for. \n\nCongratulations on your retirement! I wish you all the best throughout your new journey. \n\nSending you the deepest gratitude from Korea,\nYounghoo Cho '19\n\n\n\n\nDear Professor Robinson,\n\nCongratulations on your retirement! I wanted to take a moment to express my heartfelt gratitude for the impact you’ve had at Mount Holyoke.\n\nThank you for making mathematics so joyful and inspiring! You are such a role model, and I feel incredibly fortunate to have learned from you.

Thank you for everything you have done for our community and for the support and encouragement you’ve shown along the way.\n\nBest regards,\nYuqi Zhang\n\n\n\n\nDear Margaret, Happy Retirement! Thank you so much for revealing to me the beauty of mathematics and showing me how to be a generous teacher. I miss your classes. ––Celia Xu, 18'\n\n\n\n\nDear Margaret, I have always felt incredibly fortunate to have studied at Mount Holyoke and you are part of the reason why I had an amazing undergraduate experience. I absolutely loved your Abstract Algebra class back in 2008. The way you love teaching and interacting with students inspired me to pursue passionate career of my own. Thank you so much for being a wonderful teacher and role model. Enjoy your well-deserved retirement!  Best, Becky Ding Taylor\n\n\n\n\nDear Margaret, as you prepare for your well-deserved retirement, I wanted to take a moment to express my gratitude for the impact you've had on my academic journey and personal growth. Your passion for mathematics was inspiring and contagious. I fondly recall our Abstract Algebra class and the other challenging yet rewarding courses I took with you. Your ability to present complex concepts in an engaging and comprehensible way truly made learning a delightful and satisfying adventure. \nI still remember the quotes you put on our take-home exams, for example, the one that went something like \"after all the effort, we're still confused but about more difficult problems.\" I repeated the same to myself the other week after working on a challenging analysis.\n\nI live in Chicago now. I am a Sr Manager for Product Operations and Strategy at a software company called HubSpot. I love my job and the company. It was another Mount Holyoke alumn who recommended me for the interview ~3 years ago! I got married in July ‘22 and baby Jeremy, our first child, arrived this February. It's been a remarkable and joyful year welcoming him into the world and seeing him grow and change so quickly. Let me know if you’re ever in Chicago or if I can be helpful in any way.\nI wish you all the best in your retirement and your future ventures!\nWith warm regards and gratitude,\nGergana Kostadinova, Class of 2012\n413-221-6291. gerganakh@gmail.com\n\n\n\n\nCongratulations Professor Robinson! I really enjoyed having you as a professor for linear algebra, it was one of my favorite math classes! You taught the class so passionately and were so accommodating as I had my concussion and then we were online for COVID (this was Spring 2020). I wish you a happy retirement and hope you are able to spend more time with your family!\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Robinson! \n\nCongratulations on the culmination of an amazing career. Your Linear Algebra class opened my eyes to the beauty of math and the trans-dimensional magic (technical term) of space. Not only did this play a huge role in my thesis work (I am still grateful you agreed to sit on the committee for it), but these concepts have served as valuable building blocks for my creative work in the dance and film sphere.\n\nI hope that you have an amazing retirement and certainly let me know if you find yourself out in the Bay!\n\n\n\n\nDear Mrs. Robinson (though I suppose now that I am closing in on 50 I could call you Margaret!), I have thought of you so many times over the years. Your Calc 1 class back in 1991 (word problems with rabbits!) was a turning point for me, changing my academic trajectory. I initially took the class to complete a distribution requirement, but somewhere along the way Calculus became beautiful, due in no small part to your enthusiasm. After what was a difficult situation vis a vis mathematics at my high school, you rekindled my love for it and allowed me to consider I may actually be \"clever\" in this area, as you once told me. I mention you often when talking to younger people about their academic (and life!) choices--to allow for the possibility that beauty and passion and joy may be found in unexpected places, that seeing something through someone else's eyes, as I saw Calculus through yours, may just change them for the better. There is a student I know, likely headed to MHC next year to study mathematics, and though I am saddened to know she won't benefit from the magic of your classroom, I know that the department you were part of shaping, and the many students you inspired over the years, will continue to honor your legacy, and your influence will be felt for generations. With deepest gratitude and respect, Liz Greason '95\n\n\n\n\nCongratulations! Thank you for making math exciting and fun. I remember the days in your office we chatted about my graduation goals and tennis. Your support and reassurance throughout my journey at MHC meant a lot and I wish you a happy retirement!\n\n\n\n\nDear Professor Robinson - Congratulations on your upcoming retirement, and thank you for your wonderful teaching all of these years! I still remember how you taught and challenged us in the differential equations course I took with you 2 decades ago, and how you brought us orange juice and donuts on exam days to help us ace the test. I'll always appreciate how you held us to high standards but also supported us to succeed. These days I'm working as a biostatistician at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, at the intersection of biology, mathematics, and statistics. It's great fun and I could not have gotten here without your help, and the confidence you instilled in me to learn hard things. I wish you all the very best in retirement!! Sincerely, Viviane\n\n\n\n\nWhenever I talk about Mount Holyoke, I always share how amazing and caring the professors are. One story I often tell is about the time you called out my name as I was waiting for the elevator in the Math Building—one year after you had taught me. That moment has stayed with me for years, because my name is not the easiest to remember and pronounce, and it’s a testament to how much you genuinely care about your students. I can’t believe it has been seven years since I first took your class! After you kindly wrote me a recommendation letter, I transferred to the University of Michigan. Although I didn’t continue to major in math, my love for it remains strong. Now, I’m pursuing my master’s degree at UCLA. I rarely check my Mount Holyoke email these days, but today, while trying to subscribe to the California alum newsletter, I logged in and saw the news of your retirement. I knew I had to reach out. I’m sorry I never emailed you after I transferred—I was too shy (and still am, to be honest!). But I want you to know how much of an impact you’ve had on me. Thank you for everything, and I wish you all the best as you embark on this exciting new chapter. -- Best, Fuchun\n\n\n\n\nThank you for being a supportive advisor.  I am thankful that you did not discourage me from participating in the Budapest semester in Mathematics, even though I wasn't the smartest student, it was an amazing experience. Your joy and love of mathematics was infectious. I hope you have many fun plans for retirement! cheers, Anna (Bersagel) Lipinski '00\n\n\n\n\nMargaret was a wonderful mentor to me at Mount Holyoke and was always so supportive and encouraging. Congratulations on your retirement!\n\n\n\n\nEvery memory from your classes remind me of how to be a better teacher for my students. You got us interested and helped us along the way. Congratulations to you; thank you for all that you have done for the MHC community!\n\n\n\n\nDearest Margaret, you have been such an incredible advocate for so many of us, and I know I am truly blessed to have gotten to meet you, and especially because I have been able to stay connected through the years.  You are truly an amazing mathematician, and more importantly an incredible woman that has been a rock for so many of us when we really needed it.  Enjoy your retirement, and rest easy as you have done great works, and deserve to play!  Love Always, Vanessa\n\n\n\n\nHi Margaret,\n\nI recently learned of your upcoming retirement and wanted to take a moment to express my gratitude and best wishes. Your classes during my time at MHC from 2016 to 2019 were among the most rewarding experiences of my academic journey. Serving as your teaching assistant was an honor, and I deeply appreciated the opportunity to learn from your expertise, dedication, and kindness.\n\nOne small thing you did has stayed with me over the years—the idea of keeping a band-aid in your wallet. It was such a simple but thoughtful gesture, and I’ve been doing it ever since. It’s a little reminder of how practical and caring you are.\n\nThank you for all the guidance and support you’ve given over the years. You’ve made such a big difference in the lives of so many students, including mine. I hope you have a happy and relaxing retirement filled with exciting new adventures!\n\nBest,\nLu Yu\n\n\n\n\nMany congratulations dear Margaret! You were instrumental in helping me find my love for Mathematics, and I am so grateful! I started at MHC eager to get through the Math requirements, and one semester with you converted me into a Math major. Your enthusiasm and love for math is contagious, and your kindness is apparent. You deserve a relaxing retirement, but I am sure you will be up to plenty very soon! Lots of love!\n\n\n\n\nYou shaped what it meant to be a part of a math department at a women/marginalized gender-centric college. I appreciate your leadership and we will all miss you!\n\n\n\n\nDear Prof. Robinson, You have inspired so many in our community. I have heard from countless graduates around the world how much they enjoyed your classes and learned from your leadership. On behalf of the Alum Association, we are excited for you to become an \"alum\" of the faculty. Warmly, Trisha\n\n\n\n\nDear Professor Robinson,\n\nYou've been more than just an educator – you've been a true inspiration throughout my years at MHC and beyond. Your unique combination of patience and grace in teaching has set a standard I strive to meet in my own career.\n\nThe recommendations you wrote helped open doors for me, but what I carry forward most is the example you set. During my time as a math department chair, I often found myself asking, \"What would Professor Robinson do?\" – especially when students needed extra support and understanding.\n\nWhile Mount Holyoke is losing an extraordinary educator, your impact continues through the countless students you've mentored. I'm deeply grateful that I was one of them. Your infectious spirit, unwavering dedication, and leadership have left an indelible mark on all of us.\n\nMay your retirement bring you all the joy and adventures you so richly deserve!\n\n\n\n\nThank you for all that you have done for me and for others like me. I felt like I could truly learn from you even though I only completed one course with you and it was on zoom my first year at MHC. I always felt like I could ask questions and be wrong on a problem in front of you and I know how important that is for my learning and I try to instill this with my current students. I appreciated how much you genuinely cared for your students and what they did outside of the classroom. I always felt seen by you. Thank you.\n\n\n\n\nYou had such a profound impact on my life as a mentor. Now that I am in a position of supervising others, I try my best to be as supportive of them and their goals as you were of me - and every student who was fortunate enough to be taught by you. I hope you enjoy everything retirement has to offer to its fullest. You've earned it! (Norah Mazel, 2005)\n\n\n\n\nI have very fond memories of MHC and a lot of those have to do with not only the diverse students but also faculty.  One quick story on how Margaret touched my life beyond as my math mentor.  A colleague, fresh out of undergrad starting her career as an electrical engineering, commented on how she appreciated that I showed so much of my bubbly personality during meetings and she left comfortable doing the same.  Until then, I had not thought about how Margaret really made all of our interactions so fun and positive and I approach work with that same energy.  We are currently living in Monterey, CA with our 2 small children and expecting our 3rd this summer.  Thank you for this opportunity to thank Margaret for her mentorship!\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Robinson,\n\nI cannot begin to express my gratitude for all that you did for me during my time studying as a math major at Mount Holyoke! As I think back to the first course that I took with you (I believe it was Linear Algebra in 1993), I remember looking forward to your class and to the occasional visits I made to your office hours that were always extremely helpful! You were so vibrant and engaging that I couldn’t wait to take another one of your classes!! I was blessed to be a part of your mathematical experimentation laboratory class in the Spring of 1994. This was the most dynamic and interactive math class I have ever taken and among the most formative, because it was so different from any other math class offered. The methods I learned in the course, the basic research I conducted, the thoughtful discussion shared in class, and the lengthy reports I wrote to analyze and share my findings all provided invaluable skills, continuous opportunities for critical thinking, and wonderful memories from class! I also gained so much from you and the support you provided during this class – more confidence in my abilities, a greater interest in math research, and an even bigger passion for math than I already had! When I think about the time I spent working on mathematics at Mount Holyoke, this math laboratory course is the first class I think of!\n\nAs my journey toward a mathematics major continued, I applied for your 1995 REU summer research program in p-adic analysis. Although I was not one of the few students selected for this prestigious program, you knew that I genuinely wanted to participate to have the opportunity to experience formal math research. You went above and beyond for me that summer to allow me to be a part of your program! You secured summer room & board for me on campus, provided a space for me in your research group, and amazingly you even found some additional funds for me so that I could receive a small stipend too like the other REU students! I was able to contribute to the group and write up my own findings at the end of this outstanding program. It was one of the most challenging yet most rewarding experiences I have ever had, and I am forever indebted to you for making this experience possible for me. I know you went out of your way for me that summer, and I will always remember your kindness and your desire to help me learn! Thank you for believing in me!!\n\nOf course, this is just my own college math journey – that of a singular Mount Holyoke math major who graduated almost 30 years ago. I know your legacy is far more expansive than my small experience can illustrate, and I can only imagine how many other students you have touched, inspired, advised, supported, and mentored during your extensive and distinguished career at Mount Holyoke!! We are all blessed to have been your students! I know that Mount Holyoke’s Department of Mathematics will not be the same without you. You have given so much of yourself to your work and to your students over the years, and you will be dearly missed!\n\nBut now it’s time to focus on you, your family, and an exciting new chapter in your life! As you embark on this next journey, I wish you peace, joy, and fulfillment in all the moments that await you!! I am sending my warmest congratulations on your retirement!!\n\nRachel Stavenick Gelderman ‘96\n\nP.S. It has certainly been a pleasure reconnecting with you in the last couple of years as my daughters have attended MHC. As always, I treasure our conversations! I hope we can keep in touch! ❤\n\n\n\n\nHi Margaret,\n\nHappy retirement!\n\nWhen I heard you were retiring after this semester, it brought back so many golden moments I experienced in the math department—a place that always felt cozy and supportive. I still clearly remember the first time I reached out to you via email for advice on math courses, and at that time, I wasn’t even your advisee. Not only did I get helpful advice, but what impressed me even more was how energetic and thoughtful you were!\n\nI’m a bit introverted and sometimes get nervous talking to people, but your kindness gave me so much confidence and comfort in sharing my thoughts and opening up more. That support carried me through all of college and into life after graduation, including my applications to graduate school.\n\nI’ll always cherish the moments spent in your office—me and my classmates working through problems together, or talking with you about course planning and future goals. Your number theory class remains one of my favorites. Now I work as a quantitative analyst at an asset management firm, where I use math every day—calculus, linear algebra, probability, and more. I’m glad and grateful that the work I do is connected to what I learned in college. I deeply feel that I’m still growing on the foundation built during those years.\n\nThank you again for your warmth, generosity, and support over the years. I feel truly lucky to have been one of your students.\n\nWishing you all the best in your new adventures! \n\nWarmly,\nMiao Zhang\n\n\n\n\nHi Margaret,\n\nHappy retirement!\n\nI used to dream of the day I’d return to campus as a successful alum, sharing how my time at Mount Holyoke changed my life and career. Of course, I’m not here today as someone who can donate millions of dollars—I just finished my master’s in Data Science at NYU last week and will soon be moving to D.C. to begin my career as a Machine Learning Engineer. And of course, I once thought you might be at Mount Holyoke forever, never retiring. But even now, I carry with me the lessons you taught me—lessons that will stay with me for a lifetime.\n\nI first met you during COVID, and from that moment on, you became one of my greatest supports—both academically and personally. You comforted me when I had to take Abstract Algebra at 5 a.m. from the West Coast. You guided my course selections and encouraged me to take a gap year when I needed it most. You wrote recommendation letters that opened the doors to research programs and graduate school. And even after I graduated, you continued to check in on how I was doing at NYU—proof that mentorship, at its best, never truly ends.\n\nSo while I may still be at the beginning of my journey, here are some things I already know:\n\nI’ve learned to maintain a healthy and positive mind.\n\nI’ve learned to explore and construct my identity with patience and kindness.\n\nI’ve learned to stay sharp in abstract thinking and soft in heart to care for others.\n\nI’ve learned to think independently while staying connected to people and the world around me.\n\nI’ve learned that love and mentorship often means supporting someone—even when their decision is to leave math.\n\nAnd I’ve learned to appreciate the beauty of mathematics—even though it won’t be my career. (But much to my surprise, as an MLE, I am—and will be—using math every day!)\n\nMy Mount Holyoke education—especially under your guidance—was transformative. It shaped not only my intellect but also my values and sense of self. I know these words can’t fully express my gratitude, but I will always look back on this chapter with clarity and pride, knowing: this is where it all began.\n\nI know you won’t forget what happened here at Mount Holyoke, and I wish you the very best in this next chapter of life. You’ve made a lasting impact on so many of us—including me.\n\nWith deep appreciation,\nJingyi Wu\n\n\n\n\nDear Professor Margaret, \n\nI will always remember your enthusiasm for teaching and your patience and kindness. You were truly a bright presence on campus and obviously you have so much to be proud of. I think all of us students of yours fondly think upon you and admire you so much, at least I do. Thank you for your dedication, all that you are and do is amazing! I hope you will have a lovely and relaxing retirement and get to spend time with your family and friends and do everything that you set your wishes to. It was always the best to have pizza during Math talks and also visit you in your office hours.  \n\nSincerely,\nEsther XX"

I wanted to pursue astrophysics, but signed up for all the higher level math I could find as well. You were an inspiration. You made me feel like a math minor was possible, even with a \"double major\" like astronomy and physics. (I also had a French Minor!) I have memories of your office, chatting like adults. I'm so grateful to you. Especially because the reason I likely got into MHC was a heartfelt recommendation from Ellen Ortyl, who had worked on campus. She had connected me with Laurie Kamins, whose lovely kids I had the pleasure of babysitting for! I'm just very grateful for your existence, and how you welcomed me into the fold as a transfer student from Cape Cod. &lt;3 Happy Retirement!!!!\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Robinson, I recently heard the news of your retirement, and I wanted to take a moment to express my gratitude and share your lasting impact on me, even after 10+ years post graduating Mount Holyoke. \n\nI still remember your classes vividly. Beyond the equations and proofs, you taught me how to approach problems with curiosity and persistence—skills that continue to serve me well in my personal and professional life. Your passion for mathematics and your ability to make complex concepts engaging left a lasting impression on me, and I’m so grateful to have been one of your students. Every time I've had the chance to come back on campus, I make sure to stop by your office on the 4th floor. You've taught and inspired generations of students, and I'm proud to be one of them. \n\nI wish you all the best as you enjoy this well-deserved next phase—whether it’s filled with travel, new hobbies, or just some well-earned rest.\n\nThank you!!\nKleida Martiro\nClass of 2014\n\n\n\n\nDearest Margaret, \n\nI miss you so much and wanted to share a quick update about my life. \nAfter graduating from Isenberg in 2016, I didn't get a chance to say goodbye as I was expecting my first child in May.

Thank you Margaret for showing me pure integrity and amazing work ethics.\n\n\n\n\nDear Prof Robinson/ Margaret\n\nI can't believe that you are retiring. It seems just like yesterday we were all on Skinner Green with your two little girls aged 2 and 4. You have been an inspiration to me and many other MHC students who have crossed your path Majors and Non Majors.  From your outing club stories, and your immense enthusiasm for Mathematics and life in general and it was delight to be in any of your math classes. THANK YOU for all the support you have given me over our 30 years of friendship.  I look forward to seeing you in the Spring during my 30th College Reunion.  In Gratitude and with Much Love - Cristina Ilangakoon Class of 1995 Math Major\n\n\n\n\nThank you so much for supporting me after I graduated from MoHo and gave me suggestions that really helped me to find the direction for my application. Every time talking to you, I learned a lot! Thank you for your contribution to the school and your passion for math has always inspired me!\n\n\n\n\nDear Professor Robinson- this is Heidi Zhang, class of 2021 who served as your teaching assistant during Covid period when everything was online! I think I didn’t get a chance to take your classes and our most direct interaction is being your TA. However, I always saw you in campus and in Clapp, and my friend Amelia Tran always mentioned you to me! In my memory, you are always patient and encouraging; your smile would melt the South Hadley snow. I think if I didn’t join Mount Holyoke, I probably would not pick math as major. It was the great culture math department has and the lovely professors as you made me interested in diving deeper in this subject. Due to my study aboard second half of my junior year, and covid during my senior year, my on campus live abruptly ended, which is still a great pity and pain. But reading it from a different angle, I feel like this pity will deepen my memory of the priceless math studying and campus life in Mount Holyoke. And I really want to thank you for writing me a lovely card and sending me a MHC hat as thank-you gift after serving as your TA in my senior year. Wish you have an amazing journey after retirement and look forward to seeing you again in the near future!\n\n\n\n\nDear Professor Robinson - congratulations and happy retirement. I was in your Calc and Linear Algebra classes, and really enjoyed them! Your passion for the subject, dedication to us the students, and empathy shone through. I wish you all the best on new adventures and wanted you to know that you made an impact on my life. Thank you so much! \n- Sundus Husain (2008)\n\n\n\n\nProfessor - congratulations on retiring! Thank you so much for being my advisor for four years at MHC. To an 18-year girl, first time studying outside of her native land, you are more than a mentor and a professor, dare to say that, as if I was fortunate enough at that time, to gain a mother-like figure at MHC. Wish you all the best for your future endeavors after retirement. The best is yet to come.\n\n\n\n\nHi Margaret, this is Jingyi. I missed you so much! I'll definitely come back for your retirement celebration in the spring. 😭😭😭\n\n\n\n\nProf. Margaret, Congratulations on your retirement! I still remember our office hours and how passionate you were in maths and teaching. You also had so much patience with me and all other students. I feel fortunate to have been one of your students. Wishing you joy and relaxation in this new chapter of your life! Hope I make it to the campus to see you next year before you truly retire! \nWarmest regards, Weiding Wu\n\n\n\n\nSome of my fondest memories at Mount Holyoke have been in your class and office hours. \nI took many of your classes, but particularly enjoyed your abstract algebra class. It really helped me see the beauty in patterns. You were always incredibly kind, caring, and patient. Thank you. \n\nEnjoy retirement! You're the best!\n\n\n\n\nCongratulations!  What a legacy!\n\n\n\n\nHello,\n\nWow, cannot believe you time at Mount Holyoke is coming to end! MHC students and I were lucky to have you and I was especially lucky to have you as both my professor and advisor. Thank you for always being supportive, kind, and going above and beyond for each and every one of your students. Both you dedication and passion for students and mathematics made my math journey what it was! I hope you enjoyed all of your years there and are leaving knowing the impact that you made. I hope you feel accomplished in all of your work and research that you’ve done over the years. Hope to stay in touch. Best of Luck!\n\nStephanie\n\n\n\n\nHi Professor Robinson,\n\nCongratulations on your retirement!! Your linear algebra class I took was one of the toughest yet most fun classes I took at moho. I still remember how you would pop in when you saw me at TA hours in the night and would still offer to help solve problems. Thank you for your dedication to not just me but the 100s and more students who you’ve helped over the years. I’m now a senior analyst at NERA economic consulting still doing some math on a daily basis haha! Wishing you only the very best in your retirement :) \n\nBest\nMarihah Idroos (class of 2019)\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Robinson, What an amazing time at Mount Holyoke you have had. I will always remember my summer REU as some of the fondest times I had in college. I am so appreciative of all the guidance I received during that time. Your love and passion for math always came through in your classes; I am sure many more students feel the same. Cheers to a happy retirement! Adelyn\n\n\n\n\nI took two classes with Professor Robinson. Her enthusiam about math and teaching created such a wonderful supporting environment for me to enjoy math without fear.

Not sure I’d be where I am today without you! I know you’ll find many pursuits to fill this next chapter! Miriam ‘12\n\n\n\n\nYou really made me fall in love with math. I took Calculus I with you in my sophomore year and ended up deciding to major in math. You made the course more than just tedious calculations. Even afterwards you were always so helpful any time I emailed you for help. You’re an amazing person, and an even better professor and mentor. I was just working on a math homework assignment for my masters in AI, and it all started with taking Calculus with you. I wish you the absolute best!!\n\n\n\n\nI am so excited and happy for Professor Robinson as she enters this exciting time in her life. Professor Robinson was such a wonderful professor and person during my time st MHC. Always so positive and encouraging, I loved having classes with her and inevitably left happier than I arrived. A genuinely kind and special person. I remember returning for a reunion years ago with my two children in tow. Not only was she so happy to connect with me she spent time with my kids teaching them some math wonders - they still remember and talk about that!\n\nWishing Professor Robinson the very best and thank her for all she has given to MHC and her students.\n\n\n\n\nYour love for math inspired me to build the career that I have and share my love with my own daughters.  You are such a treasure and your impact is far reaching.  Thank you for all that you have done to further the field of mathematics and to create a space for women.\n\n\n\n\nCongratulations!  It was a pleasure to serve as your TA and a math lab tutor... 25 years ago?  That math doesn't add up!  It ended up being great preparation for my career as a law librarian and legal research professor - it helped me learn the right questions to ask while getting students/users to a proper answer. (There's not always \"the\" right answer in legal research!)  Thank you for your dedication, and best wishes for a long, fulfilling retirement.\nSuzanne Corriell, class of 2000 (statistics minor)\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Robinson! \n\nI want to thank you for all of the support you provided me in undergrad. You were not only an amazing advisor who supported me when I felt like I didn't know what I was doing, but an AWESOME math professor.

Thanks to your support, from taking your linear algebra class to writing my letter of recommendation for grad school, I’m now studying for my MPH Biostatistics & Epidemiology at CUNY School of Public Health while working as a Data Scientist at New York City Council during the day. Have an amazing holiday season & congratulations again 🩷 - Reese, ‘21\n\n\n\n\nMargaret,\nThank you for everything you have done for me. I am so lucky to have had you for Calc 1 in the fall of 2020. Although I never completed another course with you, you were always there to help me through my other math courses. Even though you had so many other students that you were teaching and had taught prior to teaching me, you still remembered details about me and the details I had shared about my sisters. I loved having you as a professor and as a mentor as I pushed my way through the decision to become a math minor instead of a math major. You were a significant part of my time at MHC as an undergrad and I wish you all the best.\nLove,\nEvelyn '24\n\n\n\n\nDear Margaret, I can't believe that it's your last semester teaching at MHC... I still remember vividly the day I reached out to you, kindly asking if you could be my academic advisor! Thank you for being such a wonderful advisor, allowing me and your other advisees/students to make mistakes and grow, and always giving us motherly advice and perspectives to support us during our 4 years at Mount Holyoke and beyond! We are grateful to have had you as our advisor! I hope you enjoy your retirement to the fullest :) ~ Amelia Tran.\n\n\n\n\nHi Margaret! Hope this message finds you well! This is Sunan and it's been such a long time since we last talked. I can't believe it's been more than five years since I graduated, and I still remember how you patiently answered my discrete math and abstract algebra questions in your office. Actually, it feels like it was just yesterday... You've been such a huge inspiration to me, and you've guided me to love math and to pursue a career rooted in math. I am forever grateful for your help and I am so lucky to be your student! Wishing you all the best in your retirement, and let's keep in touch! :))\n\n\n\n\nDear Margaret, Thank you for being my \"secret mentor\" through graduate school!  Even though at the time I had only met you briefly (in the summer of 1997 when I was on a panel for the MHC REU students), you became my go-to contact whenever I was questioning my ability to keep going in my program and to fit into the mathematics world.  In one email response you said that \"there was room in mathematics for all different sorts of mathematicians.\"  That was so powerful that I have shared it many, many times since then with my own students and people that I mentor.  It's been a delight to become your friend over the years, and I wish you all the best in retirement!  Best wishes, Reva Kasman\n\n\n\n\nIt was a pleasure having you as an advisor.  You were always upbeat, positive and excited about work.  I wish you an adventure filled retirement.\n\n\n\n\nDear Margaret - I cannot express my gratitude enough to have you as my faculty advisor and math professor! You are an incredibly kind, loving teacher, always energetic and passionate, and have the best interests of the students in mind! It's been such an honor to be your advisee - you were like a mom to me when I first step my foot on campus in the winter of 2003 as a spring entrant coming all the way from China by myself. You inspired me to get interested in math, become more confident, and helped me kick start a great career in finance afterwards. Thank you for everything! Wish you a happy retirement and starting a new chapter in your life! With lots of love, Sixuan Chen (Class of 2006, Math major)\n\n\n\n\nAs you embark on this next chapter of your life, I wanted to take a moment to thank you not only for being an incredible professor but also for being such an inspiring human being. You didn’t just teach me math—you gave me a perspective that I’ve carried with me ever since college.\n\nI still remember coming to your office hours feeling completely overwhelmed by abstract algebra, wondering how others seemed to just know how to solve problems. You reassured me that it’s not about innate ability but about familiarity and experience—the more we encounter and engage with challenges, the more capable we become. That simple wisdom has stayed with me all these years.\n\nYour encouragement and perspective helped me push through not just college but also challenges I’ve faced in my career. Your impact has been profound, and I know countless other students feel the same.\n\nThank you for everything you’ve given to your students over the years. Wishing you a joyful and fulfilling retirement—you’ve more than earned it!\n\n\n\n\n\nCongratulations on your well-deserved retirement, Professor Robinson! I’m truly grateful to have had the opportunity to take Linear Algebra with you during my sophomore year—it was such a memorable and impactful experience. Wishing you all the best in this next chapter! 😊\n\n\n\n\nHi Professor Robinson! I did not have the opportunity to take many classes with you but I did take your Linear Algebra class in the fall of 2015 and it was one of the best classes I took at Mount Holyoke. When I majored in physical chemistry in grad school, all the lessons (and my notes!) from your class were extremely useful in my quantum classes and now in my career. Thank you for everything and I wish you the best in your future after Mount Holyoke.\nAudrey Eshun, '16\n\n\n\n\nYou have been an amazing professor and mentor for  future mathematicians and non mathematicians alike. Thank you for being amazing.\n\n\n\n\nThank you for your amazing work as an educator and mentor. Though I never took a class with you, I feel privileged to have had you as a colleague and friend 🧡\n\n\n\n\nCongrats on your very last semester! Thank you for always being our \"guiding light\" and #standingwithus. Can't wait to celebrate you!\n\n\n\n\nThank you for highlighting Math in my life! Sending all my best wishes for my favorite Prof!! Hope our paths cross again before too long!\n\n\n\n\nYour magnetic presence in the classroom was unmatched! I wish I could have taken more classes with you but will always cherish the catch ups we had each semester. The field of mathematics is forever changed by your work and mentorship. May retirement bring you much relaxation, joy, and time with those you love.\n\n\n\n\nMargaret, you were the best advisor/professor I could ever ask for. I am sooo lucky to have met you at Mount Holyoke College. I am so sorry I couldn't talk to you this semester earlier after I graduated. Yet, you've been always in my prayers and heart with deep gratitude. I am happy for you to start this new chapter of your life, and I hope it is filled with other things that you love and are passionate about besides math!\n\n\n\n\nThe dreams that I dreamed of in your office through our numerous talks have expanded into a lifelong adventure — though I'm always feeling a little afraid of the unexpected, it's something I'm willing to face head-on. \nYour wisdom, passion, and care that I experienced during my Moho life have been my inspiration, which I'm forever thankful for. \n\nCongratulations on your retirement! I wish you all the best throughout your new journey. \n\nSending you the deepest gratitude from Korea,\nYounghoo Cho '19\n\n\n\n\nDear Professor Robinson,\n\nCongratulations on your retirement! I wanted to take a moment to express my heartfelt gratitude for the impact you’ve had at Mount Holyoke.\n\nThank you for making mathematics so joyful and inspiring! You are such a role model, and I feel incredibly fortunate to have learned from you. Your guidance taught me how to persevere in the face of challenges, especially during the pandemic.\n\nThe lessons I’ve learned from you—both in mathematics and in life—will stay with me forever, and for that, I will always be grateful. Thank you for everything you have done for our community and for the support and encouragement you’ve shown along the way.\n\nBest regards,\nYuqi Zhang\n\n\n\n\nDear Margaret, Happy Retirement! Thank you so much for revealing to me the beauty of mathematics and showing me how to be a generous teacher. I miss your classes. ––Celia Xu, 18'\n\n\n\n\nDear Margaret, I have always felt incredibly fortunate to have studied at Mount Holyoke and you are part of the reason why I had an amazing undergraduate experience. I absolutely loved your Abstract Algebra class back in 2008. The way you love teaching and interacting with students inspired me to pursue passionate career of my own. Thank you so much for being a wonderful teacher and role model. Enjoy your well-deserved retirement!  Best, Becky Ding Taylor\n\n\n\n\nDear Margaret, as you prepare for your well-deserved retirement, I wanted to take a moment to express my gratitude for the impact you've had on my academic journey and personal growth. Your passion for mathematics was inspiring and contagious. I fondly recall our Abstract Algebra class and the other challenging yet rewarding courses I took with you. Your ability to present complex concepts in an engaging and comprehensible way truly made learning a delightful and satisfying adventure. \nI still remember the quotes you put on our take-home exams, for example, the one that went something like \"after all the effort, we're still confused but about more difficult problems.\" I repeated the same to myself the other week after working on a challenging analysis.\n\nI live in Chicago now. I am a Sr Manager for Product Operations and Strategy at a software company called HubSpot. I love my job and the company. It was another Mount Holyoke alumn who recommended me for the interview ~3 years ago! I got married in July ‘22 and baby Jeremy, our first child, arrived this February. It's been a remarkable and joyful year welcoming him into the world and seeing him grow and change so quickly. Let me know if you’re ever in Chicago or if I can be helpful in any way.\nI wish you all the best in your retirement and your future ventures!\nWith warm regards and gratitude,\nGergana Kostadinova, Class of 2012\n413-221-6291. gerganakh@gmail.com\n\n\n\n\nCongratulations Professor Robinson! I really enjoyed having you as a professor for linear algebra, it was one of my favorite math classes! You taught the class so passionately and were so accommodating as I had my concussion and then we were online for COVID (this was Spring 2020). I wish you a happy retirement and hope you are able to spend more time with your family!\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Robinson! \n\nCongratulations on the culmination of an amazing career. Your Linear Algebra class opened my eyes to the beauty of math and the trans-dimensional magic (technical term) of space. Not only did this play a huge role in my thesis work (I am still grateful you agreed to sit on the committee for it), but these concepts have served as valuable building blocks for my creative work in the dance and film sphere.\n\nI hope that you have an amazing retirement and certainly let me know if you find yourself out in the Bay!\n\n\n\n\nDear Mrs. Robinson (though I suppose now that I am closing in on 50 I could call you Margaret!), I have thought of you so many times over the years. Your Calc 1 class back in 1991 (word problems with rabbits!) was a turning point for me, changing my academic trajectory. I initially took the class to complete a distribution requirement, but somewhere along the way Calculus became beautiful, due in no small part to your enthusiasm. After what was a difficult situation vis a vis mathematics at my high school, you rekindled my love for it and allowed me to consider I may actually be \"clever\" in this area, as you once told me. I mention you often when talking to younger people about their academic (and life!) choices--to allow for the possibility that beauty and passion and joy may be found in unexpected places, that seeing something through someone else's eyes, as I saw Calculus through yours, may just change them for the better. There is a student I know, likely headed to MHC next year to study mathematics, and though I am saddened to know she won't benefit from the magic of your classroom, I know that the department you were part of shaping, and the many students you inspired over the years, will continue to honor your legacy, and your influence will be felt for generations. With deepest gratitude and respect, Liz Greason '95\n\n\n\n\nCongratulations! Thank you for making math exciting and fun. I remember the days in your office we chatted about my graduation goals and tennis. Your support and reassurance throughout my journey at MHC meant a lot and I wish you a happy retirement!\n\n\n\n\nDear Professor Robinson - Congratulations on your upcoming retirement, and thank you for your wonderful teaching all of these years! I still remember how you taught and challenged us in the differential equations course I took with you 2 decades ago, and how you brought us orange juice and donuts on exam days to help us ace the test. I'll always appreciate how you held us to high standards but also supported us to succeed. These days I'm working as a biostatistician at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, at the intersection of biology, mathematics, and statistics. It's great fun and I could not have gotten here without your help, and the confidence you instilled in me to learn hard things. I wish you all the very best in retirement!! Sincerely, Viviane\n\n\n\n\nWhenever I talk about Mount Holyoke, I always share how amazing and caring the professors are. One story I often tell is about the time you called out my name as I was waiting for the elevator in the Math Building—one year after you had taught me. That moment has stayed with me for years, because my name is not the easiest to remember and pronounce, and it’s a testament to how much you genuinely care about your students. I can’t believe it has been seven years since I first took your class! After you kindly wrote me a recommendation letter, I transferred to the University of Michigan. Although I didn’t continue to major in math, my love for it remains strong. Now, I’m pursuing my master’s degree at UCLA. I rarely check my Mount Holyoke email these days, but today, while trying to subscribe to the California alum newsletter, I logged in and saw the news of your retirement. I knew I had to reach out. I’m sorry I never emailed you after I transferred—I was too shy (and still am, to be honest!). But I want you to know how much of an impact you’ve had on me. Thank you for everything, and I wish you all the best as you embark on this exciting new chapter. -- Best, Fuchun\n\n\n\n\nThank you for being a supportive advisor.  I am thankful that you did not discourage me from participating in the Budapest semester in Mathematics, even though I wasn't the smartest student, it was an amazing experience. Your joy and love of mathematics was infectious. I hope you have many fun plans for retirement! cheers, Anna (Bersagel) Lipinski '00\n\n\n\n\nMargaret was a wonderful mentor to me at Mount Holyoke and was always so supportive and encouraging. Congratulations on your retirement!\n\n\n\n\nEvery memory from your classes remind me of how to be a better teacher for my students. You got us interested and helped us along the way. Congratulations to you; thank you for all that you have done for the MHC community!\n\n\n\n\nDearest Margaret, you have been such an incredible advocate for so many of us, and I know I am truly blessed to have gotten to meet you, and especially because I have been able to stay connected through the years.  You are truly an amazing mathematician, and more importantly an incredible woman that has been a rock for so many of us when we really needed it.  Enjoy your retirement, and rest easy as you have done great works, and deserve to play!  Love Always, Vanessa\n\n\n\n\nHi Margaret,\n\nI recently learned of your upcoming retirement and wanted to take a moment to express my gratitude and best wishes. Your classes during my time at MHC from 2016 to 2019 were among the most rewarding experiences of my academic journey. Serving as your teaching assistant was an honor, and I deeply appreciated the opportunity to learn from your expertise, dedication, and kindness.\n\nOne small thing you did has stayed with me over the years—the idea of keeping a band-aid in your wallet. It was such a simple but thoughtful gesture, and I’ve been doing it ever since. It’s a little reminder of how practical and caring you are.\n\nThank you for all the guidance and support you’ve given over the years. You’ve made such a big difference in the lives of so many students, including mine. I hope you have a happy and relaxing retirement filled with exciting new adventures!\n\nBest,\nLu Yu\n\n\n\n\nMany congratulations dear Margaret! You were instrumental in helping me find my love for Mathematics, and I am so grateful! I started at MHC eager to get through the Math requirements, and one semester with you converted me into a Math major. Your enthusiasm and love for math is contagious, and your kindness is apparent. You deserve a relaxing retirement, but I am sure you will be up to plenty very soon! Lots of love!\n\n\n\n\nYou shaped what it meant to be a part of a math department at a women/marginalized gender-centric college. I appreciate your leadership and we will all miss you!\n\n\n\n\nDear Prof. Robinson, You have inspired so many in our community. I have heard from countless graduates around the world how much they enjoyed your classes and learned from your leadership. On behalf of the Alum Association, we are excited for you to become an \"alum\" of the faculty. Warmly, Trisha\n\n\n\n\nDear Professor Robinson,\n\nYou've been more than just an educator – you've been a true inspiration throughout my years at MHC and beyond. Your unique combination of patience and grace in teaching has set a standard I strive to meet in my own career.\n\nThe recommendations you wrote helped open doors for me, but what I carry forward most is the example you set. During my time as a math department chair, I often found myself asking, \"What would Professor Robinson do?\" – especially when students needed extra support and understanding.\n\nWhile Mount Holyoke is losing an extraordinary educator, your impact continues through the countless students you've mentored. I'm deeply grateful that I was one of them. Your infectious spirit, unwavering dedication, and leadership have left an indelible mark on all of us.\n\nMay your retirement bring you all the joy and adventures you so richly deserve!\n\n\n\n\nThank you for all that you have done for me and for others like me. I felt like I could truly learn from you even though I only completed one course with you and it was on zoom my first year at MHC. I always felt like I could ask questions and be wrong on a problem in front of you and I know how important that is for my learning and I try to instill this with my current students. I appreciated how much you genuinely cared for your students and what they did outside of the classroom. I always felt seen by you. Thank you.\n\n\n\n\nYou had such a profound impact on my life as a mentor. Now that I am in a position of supervising others, I try my best to be as supportive of them and their goals as you were of me - and every student who was fortunate enough to be taught by you. I hope you enjoy everything retirement has to offer to its fullest. You've earned it! (Norah Mazel, 2005)\n\n\n\n\nI have very fond memories of MHC and a lot of those have to do with not only the diverse students but also faculty.  One quick story on how Margaret touched my life beyond as my math mentor.  A colleague, fresh out of undergrad starting her career as an electrical engineering, commented on how she appreciated that I showed so much of my bubbly personality during meetings and she left comfortable doing the same.  Until then, I had not thought about how Margaret really made all of our interactions so fun and positive and I approach work with that same energy.  We are currently living in Monterey, CA with our 2 small children and expecting our 3rd this summer.  Thank you for this opportunity to thank Margaret for her mentorship!\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Robinson,\n\nI cannot begin to express my gratitude for all that you did for me during my time studying as a math major at Mount Holyoke! As I think back to the first course that I took with you (I believe it was Linear Algebra in 1993), I remember looking forward to your class and to the occasional visits I made to your office hours that were always extremely helpful! You were so vibrant and engaging that I couldn’t wait to take another one of your classes!! I was blessed to be a part of your mathematical experimentation laboratory class in the Spring of 1994. This was the most dynamic and interactive math class I have ever taken and among the most formative, because it was so different from any other math class offered. The methods I learned in the course, the basic research I conducted, the thoughtful discussion shared in class, and the lengthy reports I wrote to analyze and share my findings all provided invaluable skills, continuous opportunities for critical thinking, and wonderful memories from class! I also gained so much from you and the support you provided during this class – more confidence in my abilities, a greater interest in math research, and an even bigger passion for math than I already had! When I think about the time I spent working on mathematics at Mount Holyoke, this math laboratory course is the first class I think of!\n\nAs my journey toward a mathematics major continued, I applied for your 1995 REU summer research program in p-adic analysis. Although I was not one of the few students selected for this prestigious program, you knew that I genuinely wanted to participate to have the opportunity to experience formal math research. You went above and beyond for me that summer to allow me to be a part of your program! You secured summer room & board for me on campus, provided a space for me in your research group, and amazingly you even found some additional funds for me so that I could receive a small stipend too like the other REU students! I was able to contribute to the group and write up my own findings at the end of this outstanding program. It was one of the most challenging yet most rewarding experiences I have ever had, and I am forever indebted to you for making this experience possible for me. I know you went out of your way for me that summer, and I will always remember your kindness and your desire to help me learn! Thank you for believing in me!!\n\nOf course, this is just my own college math journey – that of a singular Mount Holyoke math major who graduated almost 30 years ago. I know your legacy is far more expansive than my small experience can illustrate, and I can only imagine how many other students you have touched, inspired, advised, supported, and mentored during your extensive and distinguished career at Mount Holyoke!! We are all blessed to have been your students! I know that Mount Holyoke’s Department of Mathematics will not be the same without you. You have given so much of yourself to your work and to your students over the years, and you will be dearly missed!\n\nBut now it’s time to focus on you, your family, and an exciting new chapter in your life! As you embark on this next journey, I wish you peace, joy, and fulfillment in all the moments that await you!! I am sending my warmest congratulations on your retirement!!\n\nRachel Stavenick Gelderman ‘96\n\nP.S. It has certainly been a pleasure reconnecting with you in the last couple of years as my daughters have attended MHC. As always, I treasure our conversations! I hope we can keep in touch! ❤\n\n\n\n\nHi Margaret,\n\nHappy retirement!\n\nWhen I heard you were retiring after this semester, it brought back so many golden moments I experienced in the math department—a place that always felt cozy and supportive. I still clearly remember the first time I reached out to you via email for advice on math courses, and at that time, I wasn’t even your advisee. Not only did I get helpful advice, but what impressed me even more was how energetic and thoughtful you were!\n\nI’m a bit introverted and sometimes get nervous talking to people, but your kindness gave me so much confidence and comfort in sharing my thoughts and opening up more. That support carried me through all of college and into life after graduation, including my applications to graduate school.\n\nI’ll always cherish the moments spent in your office—me and my classmates working through problems together, or talking with you about course planning and future goals. Your number theory class remains one of my favorites. Now I work as a quantitative analyst at an asset management firm, where I use math every day—calculus, linear algebra, probability, and more. I’m glad and grateful that the work I do is connected to what I learned in college. I deeply feel that I’m still growing on the foundation built during those years.\n\nThank you again for your warmth, generosity, and support over the years. I feel truly lucky to have been one of your students.\n\nWishing you all the best in your new adventures! \n\nWarmly,\nMiao Zhang\n\n\n\n\nHi Margaret,\n\nHappy retirement!\n\nI used to dream of the day I’d return to campus as a successful alum, sharing how my time at Mount Holyoke changed my life and career. Of course, I’m not here today as someone who can donate millions of dollars—I just finished my master’s in Data Science at NYU last week and will soon be moving to D.C. to begin my career as a Machine Learning Engineer. And of course, I once thought you might be at Mount Holyoke forever, never retiring. But even now, I carry with me the lessons you taught me—lessons that will stay with me for a lifetime.\n\nI first met you during COVID, and from that moment on, you became one of my greatest supports—both academically and personally. You comforted me when I had to take Abstract Algebra at 5 a.m. from the West Coast. You guided my course selections and encouraged me to take a gap year when I needed it most. You wrote recommendation letters that opened the doors to research programs and graduate school. And even after I graduated, you continued to check in on how I was doing at NYU—proof that mentorship, at its best, never truly ends.\n\nSo while I may still be at the beginning of my journey, here are some things I already know:\n\nI’ve learned to maintain a healthy and positive mind.\n\nI’ve learned to explore and construct my identity with patience and kindness.\n\nI’ve learned to stay sharp in abstract thinking and soft in heart to care for others.\n\nI’ve learned to think independently while staying connected to people and the world around me.\n\nI’ve learned that love and mentorship often means supporting someone—even when their decision is to leave math.\n\nAnd I’ve learned to appreciate the beauty of mathematics—even though it won’t be my career. (But much to my surprise, as an MLE, I am—and will be—using math every day!)\n\nMy Mount Holyoke education—especially under your guidance—was transformative. It shaped not only my intellect but also my values and sense of self. I know these words can’t fully express my gratitude, but I will always look back on this chapter with clarity and pride, knowing: this is where it all began.\n\nI know you won’t forget what happened here at Mount Holyoke, and I wish you the very best in this next chapter of life. You’ve made a lasting impact on so many of us—including me.\n\nWith deep appreciation,\nJingyi Wu\n\n\n\n\nDear Professor Margaret, \n\nI will always remember your enthusiasm for teaching and your patience and kindness. You were truly a bright presence on campus and obviously you have so much to be proud of. I think all of us students of yours fondly think upon you and admire you so much, at least I do. Thank you for your dedication, all that you are and do is amazing! I hope you will have a lovely and relaxing retirement and get to spend time with your family and friends and do everything that you set your wishes to. It was always the best to have pizza during Math talks and also visit you in your office hours.  \n\nSincerely,\nEsther XX"

    "text": "We chose to explore the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset. The data set has information on the characteristics of various breast masses. The features are calculated from the digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of the breast mass. A consecutive series of 569 tumors (212 malignant, 357 benign) provided the data to develop (train) the algorithm. We think the source of our data is reliable as the data was obtained from the University of Wisconsin Hospitals, Madison from Dr. William H. Wolberg.\nThe data set has 568 rows and 32 columns. Each row corresponds to a breast mass, while each column refers to a characteristic feature. We are interested in five variables. Four of these are quantitative:\\ - perimeter_mean: the mean size of the core tumor (mm)\\ - texture_mean: the mean standard deviation of gray-scale values (pixel)\\ - smoothness_mean: the local variation in radius lengths (mm)\\ - concavity_mean: the mean of severity of concave portions of the contour (mm)\\\nThe remaining variable is categorical: Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)."

    "text": "1. Cross Validation\nCross-validation is a class of methods that estimate the test error by rate by holding out a subset of the training observations from the fitting process, and then applying the statistical learning method to those held out observations.\n\\[\\text{CV}_{(k)} = \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{j=1}^k \\text{MAE}_j\\]\nThe goal of cross-validation is to test the model’s ability to predict new data that was not used in estimating it, in order to flag problems like overfitting or selection bias and to give insight into how the model will generalize to an independent data set. Overﬁtting occurs when a model reads too much into chance features and essentially memorizes features of the data used to build it, thus reducing reliability and the ability to generalize to underrepresented populations. Cross-validation helps prevent this by providing a more reliable estimate of how well a model would generalize to unseen data.\nWe utilized a linear regression model to build and evaluate a predictive model of breast mass perimeter by concavity.\nWe incorporated 1 predictor, 2 predictors, and then 10 predictors to our model of breast mass perimeter:\n\\[\\mathbb{E}(perimeter\\_mean| concavity\\_mean) = β_0+ β_1(concavity\\_mean)\\] \\[\\mathbb{E}(perimeter\\_mean| concavity\\_mean) = β_0+ β_1(concavity\\_mean) + β_2(concavity\\_mean)^2\\]\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\mathbb{E}(perimeter\\_mean| concavity\\_mean) = \\beta_0+ \\beta_1(concavity\\_mean) + \\beta_2(concavity\\_mean)^2 + ... +\\\\ \\beta_{10}(concavity\\_mean)^{10}\n\\end{align*}\\]\nThe visualizations in Figures 10, 11, and 12 demonstrate that the more predictors are added, the more the models become overfit to the noise in our data. The model then loses its ability to generalize to new data.\nWe have trained and tested our data by creating an 80-20 train-test split. This ensures that there is a substantial amount of training data in order to evaluate a decently sized testing set.\nWe are implementing 10-fold, 8-fold, 5-fold and Leave One Out Cross-Validation. Each “held-out” fold is our test set. We are using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as our error metric:\n\\[ \\text{MAE} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left| y_i - \\hat{y}_i \\right|\\]\nWe are implementing cross-validation techniques to the following 2 models:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\mathbb{E}(perimeter\\_mean | texture\\_mean, concavity\\_mean, smoothness\\_mean) = \\\\\n\\beta_0+ \\beta_1 (texture\\_mean) +\\beta_2(concavity\\_mean) + \\beta_3(smoothness\\_mean)\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\\[\\mathbb{E}(perimeter\\_mean| texture\\_mean, concavity\\_mean) = \\beta_0+ \\beta_1 (texture\\_mean) + \\beta_2(concavity\\_mean)\\]"

Logistic regression\nLogistics regression is modeling method that allows us to adjust the linear regression model to account for binary categorical response variables by mapping probabilities between 0 and 1 to the real number range via ideas of logs and odds.\n\nThe formula for a sample logistics regression model with \\(n\\) predictors is\n\\[\nlog(odds(Y | X_1, X_2, ..., X_n)) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_1 + \\beta_2X_2 + ... + \\beta_nX_n,  \n\\]\nwhere Y represents the response variable with a binary outcome, and each \\(X_i\\) represents a quantitative explanatory variable.\nIn the context of our 4 variables of interest, our model evaluates to\n\\[\nlog(odds(Diagnosis | X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_1 + \\beta_2X_2  + \\beta_3X_3, \\beta_4X_4\n\\]\nwhere\n\n\\(X_1 =\\) perimeter_mean (mm)\n\\(X_2 =\\) texture_mean (pixel)\n\\(X_3 =\\) smoothness_mean (mm)\n\\(X_4 =\\) concavity_mean (mm)\n\\(Diagnosis\\) (1 - malignant, 0 - benign)\n\nBecause we are applying transformations on top of a regular linear regression model, there are adjustments to how we interpret the coefficients. Since this process is similar across all explanatory variables, we will only mathematically derive the interpretation for one of them for brevity.\nLet fix the value of a tumor’s \\(X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4\\) be some constants \\(a, b,c, d\\) respectively, then our model is as follows:\n\\[(eq1): log(odds(Diagnosis| X_1 = a, X_2 = b, X_3 = c, X_4 = d)) = \\] \\[\\beta_0 + \\beta_1a + \\beta_2b + \\beta_3c + \\beta_4d \\]\nIf we increase the value of \\(X_1\\) by 1, but keep all the other values the same, we would have equation 2 like so:\n\\[(eq2): log(odds(Diagnosis| X_1 = a+1, X_2 = b, X_3 = c, X_4 = d)) = \\] \\[\\beta_0 + \\beta_1(a+1) + \\beta_2b + \\beta_3c + \\beta_4d \\]\nIf we subtract eq1 from eq2, we would have \\[log(odds(Diagnosis| X_1 = a+1, X_2 = b, X_3 = c, X_4 = d)) - \\] \\[log(odds(Diagnosis| X_1 = a, X_2 = b, X_3 = c, X_4 = d)) = \\]\n\\[(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1(a+1) + \\beta_2b + \\beta_3c + \\beta_4d) - (\\beta_0 + \\beta_1a + \\beta_2b + \\beta_3c + \\beta_4d) \\]\nThis is equivalent to saying\n\\(log \\left( \\frac{\\operatorname{odds}(\\text{Diagnosis} \\mid X_1 = a+1, X_2 = b, X_3 = c, X_4 = d)}{\\operatorname{odds}(\\text{Diagnosis} \\mid X_1 = a, X_2 = b, X_3 = c, X_4 = d)} \\right) = \\beta_1\\)\nExponentiating both sides gives:\n\\[ \\frac{odds(Diagnosis| X_1 = a+1, X_2 = b, X_3 = c, X_4 = d)}{odds(Diagnosis| X_1 = a, X_2 = b, X_3 = c, X_4 = d)}= e^{\\beta_1} \\] We can rearrange this to:\n\\[ odds(Diagnosis| X_1 = a+1, X_2 = b, X_3 = c, X_4 = d)\\] \\[= e^{\\beta_1}odds(Diagnosis| X_1 = a, X_2 = b, X_3 = c, X_4 = d) \\]\nWe can interpret the above as for every 1 mm increase in the mean perimeter of the tumor ,the odds of it being malignant increases by a multiplicative factor of \\(e^{\\beta_1}\\) after adjusting for the mean texture, smoothness, and concavity.\nWe will apply this line of thinking to a section later on as we discuss the results of our model"

But, there is no response variable \\(Y\\).\nIn K-means, we choose an integer \\(K\\), which is the number of clusters, beforehand as a tuning parameter. Let \\(C_1, \\ldots, C_K\\) denote sets containing the indices of observations in each cluster.\nThe cluster sets must satisfy:\n\n\\(C_1 \\cup C_2 \\cup \\ldots \\cup C_K = \\{1, \\ldots, n\\}\\) (each observation belongs to some cluster)\n\\(C_i \\cap C_j = \\emptyset\\) for all \\(i \\neq j\\) (no observation belongs to more than one cluster)\n\nK-means seeks to minimize the total within-cluster variation:\n\\[\\min_{C_1,\\ldots,C_K} \\sum_{k=1}^{K} W(C_k)\\]\nwhere \\(W(C_k)\\) is the within-cluster variation for cluster \\(C_k\\), commonly defined using Euclidean distance:\n\\[W(C_k) = \\frac{1}{|C_k|} \\sum_{i,j \\in C_k} \\sum_{p=1}^{P} (x_{ip} - x_{jp})^2\\] where \\(X_{ij}\\) denotes the \\(i\\)th observation of predictor \\(X_j\\).\nThe algorithm aims to find cluster assignments that make observations within each cluster as similar as possible (minimizing within-cluster variation). Each cluster is represented by its centroid (mean of all points in the cluster), and observations are assigned to the nearest centroid.\nIn our breast cancer example, we’re clustering based on tumor characteristics (like radius_mean and texture_mean) to identify natural groupings that may correspond to malignant vs. benign tumors. We chose to have k=2 clusters as we are interested in differentiating between benign and malignant. The silhouette analysis in Figure 5 shows us that k=2 is the most optimal choice both, mathematically as well as for this given research question\nWe used the MSE as our measure of error as one of the main goals in K-means is to minimize the within cluster variation which is equivalent to the mean standard error (when using Euclidean distance)."
